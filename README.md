### Dynamic Optimization

Following is a Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook) version of the Dynamic Optimization course. The best method to view these notebooks is in Google Colab.

Original course website: http://apmonitor.com/do

The goal of this effort is to help students on the following:

- Follow lectures and solve code in the same location
- Python packages are upgraded automatically in the colab
- GEKKO pip installation is verified at each code run
- Try new code techniques to solve problem
- Run code in the browser

GEKKO and ODEINT code are functional in these notebooks.
