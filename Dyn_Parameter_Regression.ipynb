    "Dynamic estimation algorithms optimize model predictions over a prior time horizon of measurements. These state and parameter values may then be used to update the model for improved forward prediction in time to anticipate future dynamic events. The updated model improves dynamic optimization or control actions because the model better matches reality.\n",

    "When the analytic solution is not available (most cases), a method to solve dynamic estimation is by numerically integrating the dynamic model at discrete time intervals, much like measuring a physical system at particular time points. The numerical solution is compared to measured values and the difference is minimized by adjusting parameters in the model.\n",
