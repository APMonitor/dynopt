        "\n",
        "<p class='vspace'>One of the most important factors in efficient and reliable solution of dynamic systems is the model formulation. Changes in model formulation are not intended to change the equations, only to put them into a form that allows solvers to more easily find an accurate solution. In each section below are some of the key strategies related to model creation and formulation. The discussion begins with a basic introduction to the APMonitor Modeling Language.\n",
        "</p>\n",
        "<p class='vspace'>Models consist of sections including constants, parameters, variables, intermediates, equations, objects, and connections. All expressions used in the equations section must be created in one of the prior sections. The initialization of individual parameters or variables is sequential in the order that they are listed in the model file. Equations, however, can be listed in any order because equations are solved simultaneously.\n",
        "</p>\n",
        "<div class='vspace'></div><ul><li><strong>Constants</strong> are values that never change. Integer values may be defined to give sizes to arrays (See <a class='urllink' href='https://apmonitor.com/wiki/index.php/Main/Constants' rel='nofollow'>additional details on constants</a>).\n",
        "</li><li><strong>Parameters</strong> are values that are nominally fixed at initial values but can be changed with input data, by the user, or can become calculated by the optimizer to minimize an objective function if they are indicated as decision variables (See <a class='urllink' href='https://apmonitor.com/wiki/index.php/Main/Parameters' rel='nofollow'>additional details on parameters</a>).\n",
        "</li><li><strong>Variables</strong> are always calculated values as determined by the set of equations. Some variables are either measured and/or controlled to a desired target value (See <a class='urllink' href='https://apmonitor.com/wiki/index.php/Main/Variables' rel='nofollow'>additional details on variables</a>).\n",
        "</li><li><strong>Intermediates</strong> are explicit equations where the variable is set equal to an expression that may include constants, parameters, variables, or other intermediate values that are defined previously. Intermediates are not implicit equations but are explicitly calculated with each model function evaluation (See <a class='urllink' href='https://apmonitor.com/wiki/index.php/Main/Intermediates' rel='nofollow'>additional details on intermediates</a>).\n",
        "</li><li><strong>Equations</strong> are either equality constraints as <em>f(dx/dt,x,p)=0</em>, inequality constraints as <em>g(dx/dt,x,p)&gt;0</em>, or expression of the objective with statements that begin with keywords <em>maximize</em> or <em>minimize</em> (See <a class='urllink' href='https://apmonitor.com/wiki/index.php/Main/Equations' rel='nofollow'>additional details on equations</a>).\n",
        "</li><li><strong>Objects</strong> are object-oriented extensions of APMonitor that are stand-alone models that are instantiated from parent objects. The children objects may include parameters, variables, equations, and objective terms (See <a class='urllink' href='https://apmonitor.com/wiki/index.php/Main/Objects' rel='nofollow'>additional details on objects</a>).\n",

Variables can be optionally designated as state variables (SVs) or controlled variables (<em>CVs</em>). The terminology of <em>FV, MV, SV,</em> and <em>CV</em> is from the process systems engineering community. In this community the <em>MVs</em> are designated as the inputs that are potentially changed by the controller and <em>CVs</em> are model outputs that are driven to target conditions. The terms <em>FVs</em> refer to either measured or unmeasured disturbances to the system and <em>SVs</em> are simply designated for viewing purposes as variables of importance. These parameter and variable classifications are specified in MATLAB or Python scripts (See <a class='urllink' href='https://apmonitor.com/wiki/index.php/Main/INFO' rel='nofollow'>additional details on FV, MV, SV, and CV classification</a>).\n",

        "\n",
        "<p>There is an inherent trade-off between accuracy and computational speed for numerical solution. Additional time discretization points generally improve the accuracy of a solution but also create additional computational burden. Fewer discretization points are needed when the dynamics are slow or the system is near a steady state solution. As a compromise finer discretization points are often used in regions of fast dynamics and more coarse discretization is used in regions of slow dynamics. Often the fast dynamics are present after a step change in an input or near the beginning of a horizon. Fast dynamics naturally decay as the system exceeds two dominant time constants after a change. The dominant time constant is generally dictated by the slowest process in the system to reach steady state. A dominant time constant is often empirically obtained by introducing a step input and simulating the system until it reaches steady state. The dominant time constant is approximately the amount of time necessary to reach (1-e<sup>-1</sup>) or 63% of the total response change from initial value to steady state.\n",
        "</p>\n",
        "<p class='vspace'>There are also cases where dynamic data has been collected from a prior event. In these cases the model predictions are desired for comparison with the dynamic data. To compare model and data at each time point, the simulation step size of the simulation is adjusted to match the data frequency. These replay simulations can take excessive computational effort when large amounts of data are available. For these cases of dynamic data reconciliation, downsampling or less frequent time steps of the data may be used by collecting moving averages, infrequent points, or \n",
        "simply predicting at less frequent intervals than the data set.\n",

        "##Slack Variables\n",
        "<p><a class='urllink' href='https://apmonitor.com/wiki/index.php/Main/SlackVariables' rel='nofollow'>Slack variables</a> are defined to transform an inequality expression into an equality expression with an added slack variable. The general expression for inequality constraints in the DAE expression is <em>g(dx/dt,x,p)&gt;0</em>. An equivalent mathematical expression of the general inequality is <em>g(dx/dt,x,p)=s</em> and <em>s&gt;0</em>. This form is desirable with solvers such as interior point methods where the initial guess must satisfy all inequality constraints or be on the inside of the feasible region. In the slack variable form, an initial guess value greater than zero for the new slack variable <em>s</em> satisfies this requirement. The APMonitor Modeling Language automatically transforms all inequality constraints into equivalent equality constraints with added slack variables.\n",

An important aspect of modeling is the overall goal of capturing the input to output relationships for a particular target application. In the case of real-time embedded systems, the complexity of the model may need to be limited to meet simulation or optimization speed requirements. Other times there is no computational time target for a solution and more sophisticated models can be solved. In each case, the correct level of sophistication should be carefully considered. One strategy for finding the appropriate level of complexity is to start with simple models and add complexity only as needed.\n",
